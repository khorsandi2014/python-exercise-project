OpenCV in python helps to process an image and apply various functions like resizing image, pixel manipulations, object detection, etc. In this article, we will learn how to use contours to detect the text in an image and save it to a text file.\n",

The second parameter flag determines the type of conversion. We can chose among cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY and cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV. cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY helps us to convert an RGB image to gray scale image and cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV is used to convert an RGB image to HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color-space image. Here, we use cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY. A threshold is applied to the converted image using cv2.threshold function. \n",

A bigger kernel would make group larger blocks of texts together. After choosing the correct kernel, dilation is applied to the image with cv2.dilate function. Dilation makes the groups of text to be detected more accurately since it dilates (expands) a text block.\n"

Each contour is a Numpy array of (x, y) coordinates of boundary points in the object. Contours are typically used to find a white object from a black background. All the above image processing techniques are applied so that the Contours can detect the boundary edges of the blocks of text of the image. A text file is opened in write mode and flushed. This text file is opened to save the text from the output of the OCR."
